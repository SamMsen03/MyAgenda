# MyAgenda
Basic Collabrative Project
This is the collabrative project that we will be doing most of our tasks within. I don't expect this to take a lot of time, again,
As it is just a project to get our feet in the water and explore the possiblities of mobile development. 
However! Again I don't plan on strictly enforcing deadlines, as I want people to feel comfortable working at a pace where they feel as though
they are effectively learning.
